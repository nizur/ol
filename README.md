# OwnLocal Test

> Implementation of OwnLocal "take home" test

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8081
yarn run dev

# build for production with minification
yarn run build
```

I used [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) to get the skeleton of this up and running.

NOTE: I haven't built any working tests for this for a few reasons:

1. I am unfamiliar with unit testing. It's something I want to learn and use though.
2. I used Vue on this project, and it's only the second time I've used it so things were fairly slow going.
3. I also have two paying projects right now, and I had to prioritize one thing over another unfortunately.
4. Trying to run tests results in an error about Vuex needing a Promise polyfill in PhantomJS.

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
